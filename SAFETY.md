# Safety & Isolation Checklist

1. Run the lab inside an isolated VM or Docker internal network.
2. Snapshot VM/containers before aggressive scans.
3. Keep logs directory private. Use redaction & hashing in shared artifacts.
4. Use rate-limiting and kill-switch scripts (start-lab.sh provides basic controls).
